# vgchartzfull


vgchartzfull.py is a python@3 script based on BeautifulSoup. It creates a dataset based on data from  http://www.vgchartz.com/gamedb/ 

The dataset is saved as vgsales.csv.

You will need to have some depencies compiled at **requirements.txt**.

It can be installed by pip.

```bash

  $> pip install -r requirements.txt

```
